# lung-cancer-classification

The primary cause of cancer-related death globally is lung cancer, and enhancing patient outcomes requires early diagnosis and detection. With the potential to improve diagnosis accuracy and guide treatment choices, machine learning (ML) has become a valuable tool for lung cancer detection. Large clinical data sets, including patient demographics, medical histories, and genetic markers, can be analyzed by ML algorithms to find patterns and associations that can be used to estimate the risk of lung cancer. Numerous machine learning (ML) algorithms, such as logistic regression, support vector machines (SVMs), random forests, and deep learning models, have been used to predict lung cancer. Every method has advantages and disadvantages, and the best one to choose will rely on the particulars of the dataset as well as the intended result. Research has exhibited the effectiveness of machine learning (ML) in the prognosis of lung cancer, with a notable degree of accuracy in recognizing benign and malignant nodules on chest CT scans. This study utilizes deep learning techniques, the Xception convolutionalneural network model, to precisely classify different forms of lung cancer. To enhance the datasets diversity and boost our models training efficacy we apply data augmentation methods Despite the encouraging outcomes, there are difficulties with using ML to predict lung cancer. These difficulties include the requirement for carefully selected and high-quality datasets, the possibility of bias in the data, and the complexity of ML modelsâ€™ elaborate decision-making processes.
